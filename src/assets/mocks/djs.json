He discovered psychedelic trance music again back in 1998 and then it was only a matter of time before he started to DJ in 2001. From the beginning, he was always on the “dark side” of the psychedelic trance. In 2004 Daniil felt in love with scandinavian forest music, so since that time his sets became more deep, mystic and foresty. "

Depending on the time he plays and the vibe of the party, it can be wide range of psychedelic music, but listener always can expect deep, dance floor friendly and trippy forest sets for the most experienced psychedelic travelers as well as for open minded newcomers. His exquisite taste in music, rich psychedelic background, personal experience of being a psytrance producer and boundless devotion to the spirit of trance makes that special moments at the party during his sets."
